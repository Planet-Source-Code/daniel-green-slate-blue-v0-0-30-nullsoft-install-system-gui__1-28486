Slate Blue 0.0.28:

Slate Blue 0.0.26:

   to-view format, utilizing drag and drop code rearrangement
   * double click for script editor
* new parsing function, more reliable (old one left parts of script out!)
* enabled the Mode menu, moved it to Compile>>Mode, allowing you
   to choose either code layout generation or gui generation
   (later disabled, since it is no longer necessary)
* interface is more spaced out, less crammed together
* added list of ALL functions, calls, etc
* cleaned up the GUI, less places to go on the main screen

   just double click any item in the code layout list to edit it

   paypal and winamp logos to the about screen
* condensed about, greetings, and contributors boxes into one

   etc)

* removed Show Script Editor menu ^see above^
* mmm, cross-form strings, used in setting the code in other forms
* adding all 113 functions/calls/etc to the editor
   * the main reason this takes to long is that I have to decide which
      functions can use the same frame, and which need their own;  this
      means I could have less than 50 unique frames, while coding all 113
   * (september 2, 12:25am - 5 functions set up)
   * (september 2, 2:41pm - 11 functions set up)
   * (september 2, 3:43pm - 13 functions set up)
   * (september 3, 12:50am -17 functions set up)
   * (september 3, 4:01pm - 11 functions set up)
   * (september 3, 10:41pm - more functions set up, going to bed early for a
      change ;0)
   * 32 functions have been removed, as they were things like $a, $b, $c, etc,
      which appear in other functions, and have no independent value
* slate blue for nsis now appears in the taskbar on app startup
* reduced height of editor by about 35%-45%
* added a function description in the editor for easy reference to the scripting
   language
* currently EDITING A SCRIPT is the ONLY function SUPPORTED; this means
   you cannot create a new script, that comes after everything else
* added New menu, renamed load and save menus
* added buttons used in creating script
* added template script containing minimal settings
* added a treeview that lists all of the functions, allowing the user to create scripts
* functions in the treeview will be sorted upon release of v0.0.27
* moved about, what's new, and to do list to a separate form, reducing clutter
