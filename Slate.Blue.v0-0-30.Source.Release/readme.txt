Slate Blue v0.0.30 Source Release - Readme
=================================
Being that this is the last release of the old Slate Blue, I thought I would release it in source format, so that only developers could use it, as it has some major problems.  This package includes a compiled EXE (v0.0.30), which could be a rather cool program if it is fixed up.
Why not use NSIS to create an installer?  no time, too busy coding v1.0.

Notes:
=====
You will need the treeview control from vbaccelerator.com to run this program; http://www.morphedmedia.com/slateblue/sb-dep0027.exe .

Slate Blue v1.0 Readme
==================
v1.0 is a significant breakthrough in SB technology; it now compiles scripts without the use of makensis.exe (the nullsoft dos program).  Instead, it runs a DLL created from the makensis.exe code (thanks pjw).
v1.0 is a total rewrite; >95% of the code is brand new.  The layout is totally changed, and the user friendliness has been upped.
a full readme.html file will be included with the final version of Slate Blue, which should be finished on or before Dec. 15, 2001.
ALL 3rd party OCX files have been removed from v1.0 (vbaccelerator.com treeview, subclassing control, etc), and have been replaced with Microsoft standard controls, to ensure compatibility.

and *POOF*, gone
